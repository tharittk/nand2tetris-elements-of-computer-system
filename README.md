# Build a Modern Computer from First Principles i.e. NAND to Tetris (Elements of Computer System)

Part 1: Hardware

Project 1 - Building 15 elementary logic gates in HDL

Project 2 - Building Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU) in HDL

Project 3 - Building memory chipset in HDL

Project 4 - Assembly Language (Practice low-level programming)

Project 5 - Computer Architecture: building Hack computer CPU, integrate with RAM to build a computer system in HDL

Project 6 - Building Assembler using Python (Translate .asm to Hack machine code)

Part 2: Software

Project 7 - Virtual Machine I: building VM Translator from .vm to .asm using Python (Stack Arithmatic, Memomry access)

Project 8 - Virtual Machine II: building VM Translator from .vm to .asm using Python (Function calling command, parser, and writer)

Project 9 - High-level Language: small project of balloon game with graphic animation using Hack Language

Project 10 - Compiler I: building Jack Compiler using Python (Tokenizer, Parser, Compilation Engine) 

Project 11 - Compiler II: building Jack Compiler using Python (Symbol table, Code generation)

Project 12 - Operating System: implementation of OS low-level services via Jack High-level language
